This is a shell that allows users to execute Linux programs. User's can set variables
that they can use in later commands by putting a '^' in front of it. The built in 
commands it has are setprompt, setdir, setvar, showprocs, done. The "run" command
executes a program normally. The "fly" command executes a program in the background.
The "tovar" command executes a program and puts the output into a variable.
